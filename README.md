# S4R (SFR)
A Script that allows you to display which song you're currently playing on spotify ingame, and even announce to other players the current playing song.

Download the .rbxl file to see the code behind my demo game! (Spotify listen along inside of ROBLOX)
or play the game here: https://www.roblox.com/games/10201579565/SFRLA

Please note you will have to input your token into the script, which you can receive here: https://developer.spotify.com/console/get-users-currently-playing-track/?market=&additional_types=

Make sure you (or your users to) check the "user-read-currently-playing" and "user-modify-playback-state" (you only need the first one for the synapse script as it only displays current playing song) for the server script to function as intended!
